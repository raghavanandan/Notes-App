# Notes-App
A basic note-making application which allows the user to create, remove and view notes




To run the app,
1. Clone the repository to your local machine and open terminal with the respective work directory.
2. Run "node app.js add --title="Any title" --body="Any text" " (Since add command takes 2 arguments, one title and one body)
    The newly added content will be stored in the 'notes-data.json' file.
3. Run "node app.js remove --title="Any title or the title already present" " (Since remove command takes only 1 argument, title)
